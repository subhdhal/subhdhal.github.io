# ✅ Resume Updated - High-Level Expertise Focus

## What Changed

### Before
- Detailed bullet points for every job (8 bullets per role)
- Read like a traditional resume
- Very detailed/formal

### After
- **High-level professional summary** highlighting core expertise
- **Core Expertise section** showing 6 key domain areas
- **Professional Background** with brief, conversational descriptions
- Focus on **impact metrics** (70%, 3x, 85%, 99.2%)
- Shows what you're great at, not every task you've done
