                <section>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In modern organizations with distributed microservices architectures, developer experience becomes a critical competitive advantage. 
                        Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are self-service tools that enable teams to provision infrastructure, deploy services, and manage 
                        their full lifecycle without waiting for platform engineers. In this post, I'll share insights from implementing an IDP that reduced 
                        service onboarding time by 70%.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>What is an Internal Developer Platform?</h2>
                    <p>
                        An IDP is a curated layer of self-service capabilities built on top of your infrastructure. Instead of teams managing raw 
                        Kubernetes or AWS APIs, they interact with higher-level abstractions tailored to your organization's best practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key components of an IDP include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Service Catalog:</strong> Discoverable, self-documenting services and templates</li>
                        <li><strong>Golden Paths:</strong> Opinionated, documented paths for common workflows</li>
                        <li><strong>Developer Portal:</strong> Unified UI for discovering and managing services</li>
                        <li><strong>Policy Enforcement:</strong> Automated guardrails ensuring security and compliance</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Service Infrastructure:</strong> Templated deployments reducing manual steps</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Problem We Solved</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before implementing our IDP, new microservices took 3-4 weeks to provision:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams submitted requests through ticketing systems</li>
                        <li>Platform engineers manually created infrastructure</li>
                        <li>Different teams followed different deployment patterns</li>
                        <li>Security and compliance reviews caused bottlenecks</li>
                        <li>Inconsistent observability and monitoring setups</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Golden Paths: The Opinionated Way</h2>
                    <p>
                        Golden paths are curated, documented workflows representing best practices for common scenarios. Rather than every team 
                        reinventing the wheel, we created standardized paths for:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code># Example: Golden Path for Deploying a Python API Service

Inputs:
  - Service Name
  - Team Name
  - GitHub Repository URL
  - Port & Health Check Path

Automated Outputs:
  1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline (Docker build, tests, security scans)
  2. EKS Deployment (with resource limits, replicas, HPA config)
  3. AWS RDS Database (if needed)
  4. Application Monitoring (DataDog agent, logging)
  5. AWS IAM Roles (least-privilege access)
  6. DNS & Load Balancer Configuration
  7. Infrastructure Code (versioned, reviewable)</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        The result? Teams can go from zero to production-ready microservice in hours, not weeks.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Service Catalog: Discoverability at Scale</h2>
                    <p>
                        With 30+ microservices across teams, discoverability becomes a challenge. Our service catalog provides:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metadata about each service (owner, slack channel, on-call runbooks)</li>
                        <li>Dependencies between services (visualization of service mesh)</li>
                        <li>Deployment status and health checks</li>
                        <li>Documentation links and API specifications</li>
                        <li>Cost allocation per service</li>
                        <li>Links to logs, metrics, and traces</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Implementation: Self-Hosted Developer Portal</h2>
                    <p>
                        We built our internal developer portal using open-source tools, enabling:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>Technology Stack:
- Backstage (Developer Portal Framework)
- Terraform + Helm (Infrastructure Templates)
- GitHub Actions + ArgoCD (GitOps Workflows)
- Kubernetes (EKS Cluster)
- AWS Services (RDS, IAM, VPC, etc.)

Workflow:
1. Developer navigates portal and selects "Create New Service"
2. Fills in service details (name, team, repository)
3. Portal generates scaffolding code and infrastructure
4. GitHub repo created with CI/CD pipeline
5. Infrastructure provisioned via Terraform
6. Service appears in catalog
7. Developer can immediately deploy</code></pre>
                </section>

                    <h2>Security & Compliance as Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        One major benefit: security and compliance are built-in, not bolted-on later.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Network Isolation:</strong> Every service gets proper VPC/subnet configuration</li>
                        <li><strong>IAM Policies:</strong> Least-privilege roles generated automatically</li>
                        <li><strong>Secrets Management:</strong> AWS Secrets Manager integration</li>
                        <li><strong>Observability:</strong> DataDog agents and logging pre-configured</li>
                        <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> SAST/DAST/SCA tools run in CI pipeline</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Audit trails and compliance reports auto-generated</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Next Steps for Your Organization</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you're considering an IDP:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify your most common deployment patterns</li>
                        <li>Start with one golden path for your most frequent use case</li>
                        <li>Gather feedback from developers</li>
                        <li>Iterate and expand to more paths</li>
                        <li>Consider open-source platforms like Backstage, Port, or OpsLevelwrap</li>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Internal Developer Platforms with golden paths and service catalogs transform how organizations scale engineering. 
                        By reducing toil and standardizing best practices, teams can focus on building features instead of managing infrastructure. 
                        The 70% reduction in onboarding time was just the beginning—the real value comes from enabling developers to ship 
                        secure, reliable code faster.
